Fortunately, Scalr can manage your DNS zones for you, should you wish to have it do so. It is as easy as logging in to your registrar and point your domain (or subdomain) to Scalr’s name servers. DNS zones are automatically updated by Scalr to reflect the Rackspace instances you are running at any given time.
