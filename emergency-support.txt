Whenever a problem arises, you need to act fast. Waiting for a response can be painful—at best it impacts user experience, at worst you lose customers. Scalr offers a support plan that addresses these requirements and guarantees that any of your issues get first priority from our support team. That means fast response time from us. Scalr emergency support provides professional support for mission-critical applications.
